# TIM+ Certificate and Trust Anchors

TIM+ uses X509 certificates and PKI mechanisms to configure and validate trusted connections between TIM+ domains.  Trust anchors and end entity certificates must be created and installed into the server in order to allow connections to be made to other TIM+ servers.  The following sections describe the creation of trust anchors and certificates as well as how trust is configued between domains using trust bundles, trust anchors, and trust circles.

* [Certificate and Trust Anchor Creation](CertificateCreation) - This section describes the processes to create trust anchors and certificates.
* [Trust Configuration](TrustConfiguration) - This section describes how to install certificates and trust anchors and how to configure trust between domains.
